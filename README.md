pyrocms.normal-theme
====================

A boilerplate template based on normalize.css. This theme is almost completely stripped of any design, and is useful as a basis to create your own custom themes.

The theme also includes a grid similar on the Twitter bootstrap grid system.

# Installation

Clone the theme to where you keeps your repos.

$ git clone https://github.com/nickpyett/pyrocms.normal-theme.git

Or download via GitHub:

https://github.com/nickpyett/pyrocms.normal-theme/archive/master.zip

Copy the contents of the repo (without the .git folder, unless you want to maintain a submodule) into the directory at your-site/addons/shared_addons/themes/normal.

I would recommend duplicating a copy of this theme and renaming it, and editing the new theme, leaving the origin in tact so other developers can see what you started with.

# Testing

Go to Content > Pages in the PyroCMS admin and create a page called About (with the slug "about") to see the grid in action.

# Browser carnage

Tested in only up-to-date Chrome so far, but I would guess it will work right back to IE7.

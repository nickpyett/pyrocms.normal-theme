pyrocms.normal-theme
====================

A boilerplate template based on normalize.css. This theme is almost completely stripped of any design, and is useful as a basis to create your own custom themes.

The theme also includes a grid similar on the Twitter bootstrap grid system.

I would recommend duplicating a copy of this theme and renaming it, and editing the new theme, leaving the origin in tact so other developers can see what you started with.

# Installation

Copy to ./addons/shared_addons/themes.

# Testing

Create an about page to see the grid in action.

# Browser carnage

Tested in only up-to-date Chrome so far, but I would guess it will work right back to IE7.
